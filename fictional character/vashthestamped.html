He will help in any way he can even if it means fighting other outlaws. He dose perfer not to fight. When someone tries to fight them he always runs away and never fights back unless he has no choice. Even though he carries a gun he doesn’t kill anyone.  His gun is usually empty because he usually spends his money on donuts. Vash can also act childish at times. No matter what happens he refuses to kill. Vash believes everybody has a right to live no matter what even if they don’t deserve it. He will do anything to save people even if they dont want to be saved or if they dont deserve it. Dispite his goofy dimenier its only a mask to hide his sorrow and guilt. he feels reponsible for his brothers sins and he fells he has to be the one to stop him. After every thing his brother has done he fells he dosent deserve to cry. Dispite all of the pain humans caused him he never loses hope. He believes one day they will accept him. Even if they hunt him he runs away as far as he can and after things calm down he will always come back to their side.</p></section>

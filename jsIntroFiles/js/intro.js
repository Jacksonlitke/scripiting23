//JS statements are ACTIONS we tell Javascript to perform
//change this content, update or add this, change the look of that

//using the console for testing
console.log("hello world");


//STRINGS are pieces of text and must alway go WITHIN quotes
console.log("I'm useing javascript!");


//conversely, NUMBERS do not go within quotes
console.log(5);


//Numbers allows you to do math stuff like seeing if something is less than something else

console.log(23+32);
console.log("23+32");
console.log("23"+"32");

//simple variables
//variables are temporary holders of data - it can change depending on conditions that we set in the code
var animal;



//we give variables a VALUE when we want them to hold something
animal="unicorn";



//variables also don't have quotes when we want to use them - although their values can
console.log(animal);



//we can overwrite or set an NEW VALUE to a pre-existing variable 
//when we do so, we don't use the keyword var again
animal="octopus"
console.log(animal);



//as you can see what is printed out to the console the second time is different because we changed the value of the variable

//CONCATENATION - This is the fancy coding word for 'adding things together'. Not in a math sense but adding bit of text or values together
//for example, what is we want to pring to the console "My favourite animal is [and whatever is in the animal variable"
console.log("my favourite animal is "+animal+"!");



//We aren't bound to just putting stuff in the console!!! This is a great way to test and debug and find errors

//Changing the DOM - Document Object Model
//We can change the content on ANY element on a page with it's ID
//we use the JavaScript METHOD getElementById() to select something
//We use the PROPERTY .innerHTML to state that we want to change the HTML that is inside of it
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML="<h3>Holy Moly! i changed the page!</h3>";
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML+="<p>woah! i can add more to it</p>";
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML+="<p>My students are so smart!!</p>";
document.getElementById('column1').innerHTML+="<img class='img-fluid' src='images/code.jpg' alt='man holding a note that says code'>";



//We can change more than just the content! We can change the looks
//This time we will add the id 'column2' to the next column over and then change the css of it!
//we will select it by the id
//Then use the .style to say we want to change the css of it and then state which property we want to change
document.getElementById('column2').style.color="#991313";
document.getElementById('column2').style.backgroundColor="#0E2549"
document.getElementById('column2').style.fontSize="24pt";

//LOGIC!
//THE MOST powerful aspect about any kind of coding is that we can use logic to create a custom interaction with the user
//This means we can give the browser instructions on what to do depending on something else
//For example, in a game, perhaps you can pick up a better weapon, which in turn causes more damage
//So the amount of damage points is BASED on which weapon is being used 



//we will create a variable that holds the 'weapon' that the user has	
var weapon = "dogs";


//Then we will print out content to the page depending on which weapon they have
//This is LOGIC
//we will use an 'IF STATEMENT' to change the message they receive based on the variable holding the weapon
if(weapon=="Squid"){
    console.log("you got Squid");
}else if(weapon=="dogs"){console.log("you got fleas!");}else{console.log("illegal weapon use!");}
       


//Let's take it a step further and say the opponent has a health of 100 points
var health = 100;

//Send a message to column3 with what the opponent's health is
document.getElementById('column3').innerHTML += "<p>Opponent health: "+health+"<p>";

//then we will define damage points for each type of weaapon
var damage;
if(weapon=="Squid"){
    damage=50;
}else if(weapon == "dogs"){
    damage=25;
}else{
    damage=0;
}


//use the console to test is the damage variable is working correctly
console.log(damage);


//Let's change column3 and send the user a message
//CONCATENTATE the 'weapon' name and the STRING ' have this much damage: ' and then the 'damage' amount
document.getElementById('column3').innerHTML +="<p>"+weapon+" have this much damage: "+damage+"</p>";


//Now let's say the user has hit the opponent with their weapon
//We need to MINUS the 'damage' from the opponents 'health'
health = health - damage;


//then send the message with the new 'health' value
document.getElementById('column3').innerHTML += "<p>Opponent health: "+health+"<p>";


//Hit them AGAIN and send the new health message
health = health - damage;



//then send the message with the new 'health' value
document.getElementById('column3').innerHTML += "<p>Opponent health: "+health+"<p>";
